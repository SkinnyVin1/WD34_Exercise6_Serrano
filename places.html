                <h2>HISTORY OF SIARGAO</h2>
                <p>First recorded sighting by Europeans of Siargao Island was by Spanish navigator<br> Bernardo de la Torreon board of the carrack San Juan de Letrán in 1543,<br> when attempting to return from Sarangani to New Spain. <br>It was charted as Isla de las Palmas (Palm Island in Spanish).<br>One of the best known surfing waves on Siargao and the Philippines,<br> with a worldwide reputation for thick, hollow tubes is "Cloud 9". <br>This right-breaking reef wave is the site of the annual Siargao Cup, <br>a domestic and international surfing competition sponsored by the provincial government <br>of Surigao del Norte.
                The wave was discovered by travelling</p>
