            <h2>BEST THINGS TO DO IN SIARGAO</h2>
            <p>Siargao Island is a tropical paradise located in the Surigao del Norte province of the Philippines. This teardrop-shaped island has grown steadily in popularity over the past few years and is often known as the country’s surfing capital. Visitors come from all over the Philippines and across the globe to experience the world-class surf, white sand beaches, beautiful sunsets, natural rock and cave pools, and smaller neighboring islands. There is something here for every kind of traveler, whether you are looking for excitement or relaxation. Siargao Island is usually accessed through Sayak Airport, which is about a 10-minute drive from the municipality of Del Carmen and a 40-minute drive from the main tourist town of General Luna.</p>

        <h2>Maasin Village palm tree swing</h2>
        <p>The Instagram-famous bent tree of Maasin Village is just a quick, 30-minute drive north of General Luna in the direction of Tayangban Cave Pool and Magpupungko Rock Pools. The tree bends out over a river, and the locals have attached a swing to it that you can jump from into the water below. This is a very relaxed and picturesque spot where you are likely to meet a lot of the friendly locals. It is a unique and very worthwhile experience.

            You will know you have reached the tree once you hit the red bridge at Maasin Village, which you can see the bent tree and the rope swing from. There is a small fee of 20 pesos to use the swing, and locals rent out boats for only 150 pesos that you can use to paddle up and down the river. If you want to make sure you have the swing all to yourself to take some epic pictures as you swing into the river, try to come as early in the morning as possible.</p>

        <h2>Sugba Lagoon day trip</h2>
        <p>Another highly recommended day trip when visiting Siargao Island is to Sugba Lagoon. Located on the smaller Kangbangyo Island just west of the main island, Sugba Lagoon offers an unforgettable adventure. The beautiful turquoise lagoon is surrounded by mountains and can be explored by canoes, paddleboards, and bamboo rafts. It is also a fantastic spot to go snorkeling, and there is a diving platform as well. Best of all, though there will likely be other tourists there, it isn’t usually overly crowded, and the lagoon is plenty big enough to enjoy your own private corner of it. A tour to Sugba Lagoon usually costs around 1,500 pesos per person.

            Your day will begin with either an hour and a half boat ride from General Luna or an hour boat ride from Del Carmen, depending on where you chose to depart from. Once at the lagoon, you will be taken to a large floating pontoon house located right in the middle of it. It’s a good idea to rent a table for 50 pesos so that you can have a place to leave your belongings while you head out to explore.</p>

        <h2>Surfing</h2>
        <p>You’ve come to one of the best surfing spots not only in the Philippines but also in the world, so why not? If you don’t know how to ride the waves, there are numerous surf lessons offered at the surf break sites. Also, the good thing about Siargao is that it covers all degrees of expertise, so whether you are a newbie or an expert, there’s a surf break that is right for you. Beginner’s surfing lesson starts at P1000 for two hours.

            The waves are perfect for surfing all year round, but the best time is from as early as July to as late as January. The waves can become gnarly from September to November. Please be extra careful especially if you are just new to surfing.</p>
