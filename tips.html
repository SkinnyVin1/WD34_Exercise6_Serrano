        <h2>Siargao Itinerary – The Ultimate Siargao Travel Guide</h2>
        <p>Siargao was recently awarded for being the BEST island in the world (2018/2019) and since then it has become the most popular island in the Philippines!

            The island is more commonly known for its world-class surf breaks, such as Cloud 9, though there are plenty more fantastic things to do in Siargao other than surfing.
            
            I recommend spending anywhere between 1 to 2 weeks on Siargao to explore the best of the best that this teardrop-shaped island in the south of the Philippines has to offer.</p>

        <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT SIARGAO</h2>
        <p>Siargao Island is a year-round destination although the peak tourist season is in the dry season which is between the months of March and October.

            The off-peak season in Siargao is during the wet season which is generally between November and February. This is when there are likely to be fewer tourists.
            
            For surfers visiting Siargao Island, the best months for surfing is during the swell season which is August through to November.</p>

      <h2>HOW TO GET AROUND THE ISLAND</h2>
      <p>The best way to get around the island is on a scooter.

        The cost for a scooter rental is around 300-400 pesos per day, or for a monthly rental, you’ll get a cheaper rate of 200-300 pesos per day.
        
        Most Siargao accommodations will be more than happy to help you organize a scooter rental for the time you plan to spend on Siargao Island.
        Petrol can be found on the side of the road out the front of small local houses/businesses in the majority of the main villages in Siargao.

        Petrol is sold in 1-liter glass bottles for 60 pesos per bottle.</p><br><br>
